My first Node.js Discord Bot
features:
- reacts with "NICE" on post containing the word "nice"
- 1% chance of reacting with a thinking emoji

command list:
- ^(your message) to react with your message in emojis,
- ^^(message) to react on the 2nd message up, ^^^(msg) for 3rd ans so on
- ^thonk (optional number), e.g "^thonk 4" to react with 4 thonk emojis.
      -You will have to have to have emojis with the "think" or "thonk" in the name, on any server the bot is on
- d6 - roll a d6, works with any number from d2 to d40

Markdown:
send ++text++ to make the bot delete the message and resend the it with emoji letters
